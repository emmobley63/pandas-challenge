Heroes of Pymoli Analysis


We are given a data set of players and their purchase history and demogrpahics for the game Heroes of Pymoli. With it, we were tasked with analyzing the purchase data by gender, age, spending, top spenders, most popular items and most profitable items.

By running a count on each gender and dividing them with the total count of players within our sample we saw that the majority of our sample (~84%) are males.

We found that on average other/non-disclosed players spent the most total with $4.56. However we must take into consideration the small sample of only 15 other/non-disclosed. On average, women spent the second most total at $4.47. Males spent $4.07. Due to our small sample size on both other/non-dsclosed and women it is tough to say there is a meaningful difference between them and the males. We should look further into this. If this were true we should develop a strategy for marketing to more women and other/non-disclosed.


Through the data we found that the game had the most players in the 20-24 year old range with ~45% of the players being in that age range.
