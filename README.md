Heroes of Pymoli Analysis


We are given a data set of players and their purchase history and demogrpahics for the game Heroes of Pymoli. With it, we were tasked with analyzing the purchase data by gender, age, spending, top spenders, most popular items and most profitable items.

By running a count on each gender and dividing them with the total count of players within our sample we saw that the majority of our sample (~84%) are males.


Throught the data we found that the game had the most players in the 20-24 year old range.
